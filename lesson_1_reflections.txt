How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?
It will help you to quickly identify where the mistake is do to a typo

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit , like you do in Git, vs having automatically saved, like Google Docs
does?
Pros:
-You can do more logical commits.
-You can do commits when you need them 
Cons:
-You can create as much commits as you want

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
becouse it is easy to keep a track of the whole idea that your were working at
that time.

Config proxy in Git
 git config --global http.proxy http://x192160:Nrgr1503881@10.92.8.21:80

unset proxy
 git config --global --unset http.proxy
 
get proxy 
 git config --global --get http.proxy

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
yo can use them to check first which are the changes or commits that have been
 applied to a project and what differences are between each commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?
with this kind of tools it is easier to find wich could be de error and go back 
to prevos version of your code en fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to try it in my projects :)
